I'm very pleased to have been promoted to Senior Software Developer at Masters of Pie.

Over the past 3 years I have been fortunate to have worked across a wide spectrum of interesting and innovative projects at Masters of Pie. I have used my C++ and computer graphics experience to help contribute to Radical's native 3D/XR renderer, written clean customer-facing code for the Radical SDK, and more recently, have been a key contributor working on XR solutions for defence making use of the Radical SDK. It has been a transformative time, and I am grateful for the professional growth I've been able to experience during my time so far at Masters of Pie.

As I've grown more experienced and familiar with various codebases across the company, I've helped share my knowledge with the team, mentoring junior developers. I look forward to continuing to do this as part of Senior Software Developer responsibilities.

I've also had the chance to improve non-technical skills which I'll carry forward with me for the rest of my career, such as in software demonstration and presentating to customers. In 2022, I had the opportunity to travel to the USA to do this taking steps out of my usual comfort zone behind a keyboard and providing value in other ways.

Onwards to the next chapter of my professional journey as a Senior Software Developer. I'm excited to see what comes next and to continue finding new ways to grow!
