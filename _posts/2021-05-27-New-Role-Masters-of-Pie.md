After a great 3 years working at Rockfield, where I've grown a lot as a developer transitioning from education into the professional world, it's now time to move on to some new exciting challenges.

I'm pleased to announce that I have started a new role as a Software Developer at Masters of Pie, developers of [Radical SDK](https://www.mastersofpie.com/products/radical-for-enterprise/).

Radical SDK is a .NET SDK built to streamline the process of enabling real-time collaboration within a new or existing software solutions. The cutting-edge collaboration technology implemented at Masters of Pie has been used to deliver collaborative immersive (VR/AR) experiences that have transformed industry workflow, such as its use within Siemens NX CAD software, providing a one-click VR mode for collaborative design reviews.

Unlike my previous role which was primarily using C++, this role will involve mostly C# development, a language I gained experience with while obtaining my master's degree from Swansea University, as well as through personal projects. I also gained some experience working with immersive technologies during University which will be valuable for this new role, such as the [augmented reality warehousing tool](https://thomasfisherse.github.io/2021-01-20-AR-Warehousing-Tool/) I worked on in my final year industry team project.

I'm looking forward to my time at Masters of Pie, and am particularly excited to be working on such innovative software solutions making use of new and interesting technologies. I am also grateful at the opporunity to expand my professional software development skillset further, working with new technologies, but also in being able to work on customer-facing code since I will be contributing to an SDK.
