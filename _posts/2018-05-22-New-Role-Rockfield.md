I'm pleased to have lined up my first professional role as a Pre/Post-Processor Developer at [Rockfield](https://www.rockfieldglobal.com/), starting the day after the last exam for my Computing (MEng) degree at Swansea University.

Rockfield develop Elfen, a numerical modelling technology suite used to solve complex technical problems in fields such as glass design and geomechanics. In this role, I will help contribute to the pre/post-simulation processing tools available with the Elfen suite.

I will primarily be working with C++, using the Qt framework to develop desktop applications. During my degree I gained some valuable experience with C++, having used C++ to implement a neural network as part of my third year dissertation project, and taken an advanced object oriented programming module focussed on C++ development. Qt is new to me so I am excited to develop new skills with this technology while building on my C++ knowledge.
