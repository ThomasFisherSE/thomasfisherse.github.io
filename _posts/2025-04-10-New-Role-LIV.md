I'm very pleased to be working with the talented folks at [LIV.tv](https://www.liv.tv/) as an XR SDK engineer. I'll be helping the XR team at LIV with the development of their innovative SDKs for XR capture, such as [LIV Creator Kit](https://www.liv.tv/lck-creator-kit) for Unity.

LIV provides XR capture solutions for some of the most popular VR games. This inclues Mixed Reality Capture via the LIV SDK for games like Beat Saber (check out [this video](https://youtu.be/Wgg2YpajT8Y?t=204) of Simu Liu playing Beat Saber on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, using LIV tech). Also, with the release of LIV Creator Kit in October 2024, LIV is providing developers with in-game capture tools like the LCK tablet, currently available in games like the massively popular Gorilla Tag (check out this [showreel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHsieb1gJY4)).

As a gamer for just about as long as I've been forming memories, and as someone who likes to [work on game projects myself](https://thomasfisherse.github.io/2021-01-20-EvoGame/), I'm super excited about this move to working within the gaming industry. I'm eager to make my own impact in helping to shape the future of XR content creation.
