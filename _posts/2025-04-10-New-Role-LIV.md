I'm very pleased to be working with the talented folks at [LIV.tv](https://www.liv.tv/) as an XR SDK engineer. I'll be helping the XR team at LIV with the development of their innovative SDKs for XR capture, such as LCK ([LIV Creator Kit](https://www.liv.tv/lck-creator-kit)) for Unity.

LIV provides XR capture solutions for some of the most popular VR games, including Mixed Reality Capture via the LIV SDK for games like Beat Saber, and in-game capture tools like the LCK tablet available in the massively popular Gorilla Tag. 

As a gamer for just about as long as I've been forming memories, and as someone who likes to [work on game projects myself](https://thomasfisherse.github.io/2021-01-20-EvoGame/), I'm super excited about this move to working within the gaming industry. I'm eager to make my own impact in helping to shape the future of XR content creation.
